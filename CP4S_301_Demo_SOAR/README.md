# CP4S 300 Use Case SOAR

## 1 SOAR Persona

This document describes a functional walkthrough of basic SOAR capabilities. It is broken up into two walkthrough sections: Incident Responder/Security Analyst and a Playbook Designer. 

### Persona	Use Case
#### Incident Responder / Security Analyst	
Identify, process and respond to security risks that are occurring in your organization. Analyst response can require data enrichment in the case and leveraging SOAR integrations in your environment to minimize and/or remove on going security threats. 

#### Playbook Designer	
The IBM Security SOAR platform provides a variety of tools to help you design and implement your playbook. The coordinated application of all of these features make dynamic playbooks a powerful tool for accelerating the execution of methodical incident responses processes and, ultimately, remediation of incidents.
