# CP4S 400 Capability Demonstration Risk Manager

## 1 Demo Use Case overview

With the current version of Risk Manager on CP4S v1.6, there are 3 broad use cases for 2 personas. I’d recommend tailoring the demo depending on the audience you are demoing to. 
The 3 use cases and the corresponding personas are:
